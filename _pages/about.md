I am a graduate student at Steward Observatory/Department of Astronomy at the University of Arizona, Tucson. I am a member of the [Arizona Cosmology Lab](https://azcosmolab.org/) and I primarily work on the large scale structure/survey cosmology. My work bridges the gap between theoretical models, hydrodynamical simulations, and data to develop new methodologies for cosmological inference.
